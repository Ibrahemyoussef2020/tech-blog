                    Digitalization is inexorable, and it is occurring at an unprecedented rate. IoT, robots, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and big data are examples of new technologies that have the potential to transform the way we live, work, and communicate. Without a doubt, technology will be a critical component of the majority of people's jobs in the future, with everyone, at all levels, requiring far more advanced technological capability than they do today. Data analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning, human-centric interactions, and information security specialists will be in high demand.

                            The idea that technology would destroy the employment market is not new, but with the advent of new technologies, automation may occur more faster than previously. Automation is altering workplaces and will bring profound changes to practically every industry in the coming years. Schmidt does not believe that robots will replace humans in the workplace, but rather envisions collaboration between humans and robots. Highly repetitive and tedious work will be automated, freeing up human resources for more creative and fascinating tasks. He views robots as a tool for increasing performance and production while eliminating the mind-numbing, monotonous duties that many people face every day.
